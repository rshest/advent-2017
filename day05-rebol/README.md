Day05 solution in [REBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol).

### Why?

It has a few interesting ideas, e.g. it's [homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) and also apparently inspired the creator of JSON.

Very lightweight as well.

### Running
* [Download REBOL](http://rebol.com/download.html)

* Put `rebol` executable on a `PATH`
* Run it:
```bash
$ make
```
