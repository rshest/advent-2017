Day20 solution in [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) language.


### Why?

It's an [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language))-derived, multi-paradigm, production quality, badass programming language.

It inspired many other modern programming languages, in particular F#, which is a very close offspring.

It was fun programming in general, pretty much like it usually is in F#. In my opinion, the latter still beats OCaml in many regards, though.

One thing I did not like much in OCaml (as opposed to F#) is standard library APIs, e.g. regex and hashtable ones are totally counter-intuitive. There apparently exist (widely used) libraries that fix this, but I wanted to avoid extra dependencies.


### Installation

Install OCaml.

On Ubuntu it may look like:


```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ocaml
```

### Running

```bash
$ make
```
