Day07 solution in [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org).


### Why?

Groovy is kind of less actual these days, but it's still widely used in e.g. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

### Running

[Install Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html) (sdkman way is probably the easiest),

```bash
$ make
```
