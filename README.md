My [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) problem solutions.

This year I am trying to do it according to the following rules:

* Use a different programming language every day
* Don't solve problems in any of the languages that I already [used the last year](https://github.com/rshest/advent-2016). Unfortunately, this crosses out a few darlings. But in the "real life" you don't get much choice either :)
* It should be a _real_ programming language which is (or could be) used in production. No brainfuck, in other words
* Try to pick a language that fits the problem well - as much as possible, given the constraints
* It's fine to shamelessly cheat and do it first in a [quick-and-dirty Python](all-python-unplugged.ipynb) (to come up with the algorithm and find the actual solution), and only then take time to read up on every language's material and do it in a hopefully better way in that other language


I am testing all the code on Linux Mint 18.

Please check `README.md` files in every corresponding folder for more details.
