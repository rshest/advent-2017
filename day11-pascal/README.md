Day11 solution in Pascal.

### Why?

One of my first languages, it causes warm and fuzzy feeling.

Also, there are still quite a few applications in Delphi out there, so the language is very much used.

### Installation

I am using Free Pascal, e.g. on Ubuntu:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install fp-compiler
```

### Running


```bash
$ make
```
