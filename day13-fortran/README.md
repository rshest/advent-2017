Day13 solution in [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran).

### Why?

Fortran is important for historical reasons, besides we are still running a lot of Fortran code every day, without maybe realizing it (e.g. things like LAPACK and BLAS that are used in many scientific packages).

Otherwise it's not much pleasure to program in, for me most of the time was spent figuring out how to parse the input from the text file, and the result is ugly.

### Running

Install [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran).

```bash
$ make
```
