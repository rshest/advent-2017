Day10 solution in [Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave).

### Why?

Octave is an open-source copycat of [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB), the latter being very often used by engineers to develop algorithms.

The programming language itself is almost exactly the same, and the differences are:

* MATLAB is very expensive, Octave is free
* MATLAB is slow, Octave is ridiculously slow
* MATLAB is stable, Octave is not so much

Nevertheless, it's still a legit alternative to MATLAB in case if using the MATLAB programming language is a requirement.

### Installation

Install Octave:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install octave
```

### Running


```bash
$ make
```
